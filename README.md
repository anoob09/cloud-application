## Tools used for while developing the application
  1. React
  2. Redux (for state management)
  3. Redux Saga (as middleware for handling async tasks)
  4. React Router Dom (for navigation within application)
  5. Tailwind
  6. Material UI 5 (as component library)
  7. emotion/styled (for writing css within js and styling inner elements from Material UI components)

In this project, I have focused more on the functionality and code instead of styling because it was taking longer then expected. The website is pretty responsive as well for all screen sizes. 
Note: I had to remvoe Redux Saga since it felt like overkill for a simple task.
